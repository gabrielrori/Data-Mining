# Data Mining Repository

This repository holds a variety of notebooks and implementations showcasing data mining techniques and their applications.

## Contents

1. **ARMA ARIMA PUCP.ipynb** 
     - In this Jupyter notebook, ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average) and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) time series forecasting models are discussed and implemented. 

2. **Classifier Boundaries.ipynb**
     - This notebook explores the concept of classifier boundaries, illustrating their role in decision-making within machine learning algorithms.

3. **MNIST CNN GradCAM.ipynb**
     - This Python notebook showcases an application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the popular MNIST dataset. It particularly emphasizes on Grad-CAM, a technique for making sense of the predictions made by these models.

4. **Solar Sunspot Prediction LSTM.ipynb**
     - This notebook illustrates the use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for prediction tasks, using solar sunspot activity as example data.
